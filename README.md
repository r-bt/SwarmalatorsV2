# Swarmalators

The swarmalator model enables mobile agents to couple their internal states (phases) to each other so
their motion is dependent on their phase behavior and their phase behavior is dependent on their relative
positions. It gives rise to various emergent behaviours including:
* Phase waves
* Radial oscillation
* Multiple bouncing clusters

This repo runs the swarmalator model on a collection of Sphero Bolt robots
